# Regression from Scratch

This repository demonstrates how to implement simple linear regression from scratch using Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The project analyzes the relationship between TV marketing budget and sales using gradient descent for optimization.

## Features

- Loads and explores a marketing dataset (`tvmarketing.csv`)
- Visualizes the relationship between TV advertising budget and sales
- Implements linear regression using gradient descent (without scikit-learn)
- Plots the regression line over the actual data
- Calculates and displays the final model parameters and mean squared error

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries with:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
